A crystalline structure hovers in a sea of black and blue, surrounded by a misty fog. The glass which makes the crystal-like island shimmer from within, giving it its geometric shape, was tinted a shade of light blue. Each pane, enormous in size and perfect in its clarity, was framed in silver, making a sort of fractal grid. Our point of view is unique; no living thing has been able to see this hovering, pulsating thing out in space, not for a very long time. Nowadays, it is seen in diagrams, in photos in sections, and in small pieces. Of course, it is mostly seen from within, where it is even more glorious.

The word "intricate" doesn't begin to describe the structure that is Dulcity. There are areas equally seen and unseen in bright lights, divided by walls, floors, screens, and ever-moving slats of metal. Dulcity was a floating island completely lived in, in both dark and light, while containing multiple shimmers of rainbow color all at once. It was a bottle of life, constantly alive, the lights constantly flashing in a constant rhythm; some regular and others spontaneous. Dulcity loved color because its people loved color.

On this day, Dulcity was twinkling and glittering in the sea of space, as it always did, ever so slowly. And it always would, so safely, unaware of what was outside of it. That was fine. There was nothing to think about outside Dulcity. They had to maintain their systems and their hardware and of course, themselves. That was enough work already. They were the last living people, and they were going to spend their time leaving a legacy to each other and themselves. After all, everyone else was dead.

The room was emerald with gold accents. The emerald washed over the walls, floor, and straight-edged columns in the form of elegant gleaming marble. The gold took the form of bold stripes and small curlicues on the edges of all the framed artworks that hung on the four walls, but it also made up the entire thick, bordered frame of a heavy, rectangular mirror, about 5 persons wide and 2 persons tall. The mirror stood in the center of the room as the columns surrounded it like they were its protectors. A smell of crisp apple wafted through the air, and a fresh breeze blew coolness into the room. You could hear the sound of gentle running water coming from outside the room because the double doors were left wide open to the grey stone garden.

Two women stood in front of the mirror. One stared straight into it; a tall redhead with a thick, muscular and toned body wearing a small white cropped undershirt and a pair of small black shorts. Her grey eyes looked empty, matching the rest of her emotionless face. It looked like she might be dissociating. The other woman was a shorter, bright-looking woman wearing a red dress that ended at her knees. She had blonde hair in two braids that hung over her shoulders. She shuffled her feet, looking at the other woman expectantly, her arms crossed. The blonde woman was standing in front of a stand with two dresses hanging on it - a long, black affair and a beige skirt suit.

"Have you made a decision, Annie?" asked the one with the blonde braids. "We have to get you ready," she implored, her tone getting sharper. She has the trill of a bird in her high pitched voice; a lightness and singsongy quality that would sound lovely if she weren't so impatient.

Annie didn't respond.

"Anastacia?" the blonde one asked, tentatively. Anastacia now turned her head. "Anastacia, have you decided?" the blonde asked again.

"The black one, Ollie," Anastacia responded in a dull tone. She had a thicker voice, deeper and richer, coming from the belly and the chest. 

"That'll be with the heels and lighter makeup then, and the hair--"

"No heels, I hate them," Anastacia interrupted. She put her hands on her hips and stared into the mirror, as if menacing herself. But Ollie grimaced.

"You know the heels go with the black dress."

Anastacia shook her head. "No heels. I don't care."

"You have to care. You'll be disrespecting the creation."

Anastacia narrowed her almond eyes to a tight squint. She huffed but didn't say anything.

Ollie sighed. "We'll do a half heel sort of thing. A compromise. I'll explain you get dizzy. But there'll be rumours you're not healthy, do you get it?"

"Yeah, don't care." Anastacia shrugged. Her figure softened and she turned to the rack. "Let's just get this thing on."

Ollie smiled. "Good, good, let's get it done! Always good to just...get it done and over with..."

"That's all you'll get from me."

Ollie turned away from Anastacia to cringe, and to walk towards a small metal box about Ollie's knee height. She tapped the top to reveal some glowing symbols, and after some more presses, a door on the front of the box opened. A pair of black open-toed heels made of a synthetic leather slid out together on a metal plate. Ollie picked them up and turned to bring them to Anastacia, who had already started to put the dress on. Ollie shook her head.

"I wish you'd wait..." she started, but it was no use and she knew it. She tut-tutted as she approached Anastacia. "Let me help you," Ollie insisted. Anastacia did nothing but grunt as she pulled the skirt of the dress up past her curvaceous hips. Ollie smiled at the sight. She knew Anastacia was going to look phenomenal tonight, and that, at least, was a good thing. A great thing, actually, for Ollie. Ollie was going to be successful, no matter what, and nothing would reflect badly on her this time. 

Ollie tugged at the waist and helped Anastacia with the dress's transparent sleeves, covered in abstract lines in a sort of embroidered net on the thin mesh-like fabric. It looked so fragile, but it held well against the harsh lines and strong shapes of Anastacia's arms and shoulders. The straight line over her collar created the stark contrast between her dusky skin and the velvety black. Anastacia looked beautiful. Her body looked beautiful. Ollie got the shoes on Anastacia's feet and she now towered like a statue. Anastacia was more than beautiful now, she was a walking monument to the potential of human life. Ollie's eyelashes fluttered. That would be her Annie up there, tonight.

"Makeup," Ollie said aloud, breaking the spell on herself. "Be right back."

She picked up a bag that looked like a silky cushion with woven handles and opened it on the ottoman in front of the mirror. "Alright, take a seat and we'll get you finished in a minute."

Anastacia wordlessly did as she was told with the blank stare in her eyes again. She was somewhere else.

Ollie began with the makeup in silence. She began by highlighting the high cheekbones Anastacia was blessed with, than moved on to deepening the colour Anastacia's lips desperately needed. As soon as the lips were done, Anastacia began to speak.

"Do you remember school at all, Ollie?"

Ollie's lips parted in surprise. She blinked a few times, speechless and unsure. She spoke in a light, whispery voice in response, so different than her authoritarian little chirps. "S-sure, don't you? Doesn't everyone?"

Anastacia smiled. "Don't you think about those days? All the funny little stories of the past?" Her eyes filled with tears and Ollie was relieved she hadn't started there yet.

"Oh! Don't get that way!" Ollie whispered, rushing her words as she began to panic. Her face was so close to Anastacia's and she could see the way the tears in Anastacia's left eye were pooling in the very corner, threatening to leak out and it made her heart quicken. 

Ollie picked up a tissue and made a move to dab at Anastacia's eyes, but Anastacia pushed her hand away. "I'm fine. Just give me the tissue." She did it herself, with Ollie waiting patiently.

Anastacia signalled to Ollie. She held out the used tissue, like she wanted Ollie to throw it away for her. As Ollie took the tissue, Anastacia reached out with her other hand and held Ollie's hand for a brief moment. "You were always...you're my best friend," she said. "We've been best friends forever, since we went to school together as kids with the rest of the Tacticles."

Ollie creased her eyebrows in concern. "I know how we grew up, Annie!" she exclaimed, exasperated.

Anastacia still went on the same way. "Do you remember what we used to do together? How we used to live? How you used to talk to me?"

"I'm sorry but I don't understand your point," Ollie said, restraining herself with a gritting of her teeth.

"And...do you realize how different you sound now?" asked Anastacia, her eyes boring into Ollie's. A stranger would find her glare intimidating for one reason, but Ollie felt that way for her own, very personal, reason.

"You're always bringing this up but you never say what you mean. You need to speak to someone about this," Ollie said, turning her eyes away from her friend. Because that is the truth, they were indeed friends. Just not right now.

Anastacia said nothing more. Ollie waited a few seconds before resuming her job, which was to beautify and personally assist one of the most important Curators in Dulcity, who also happened to be one of the most difficult Curators in Dulcity, and who also happened to be the Chosen Partner to the Curator Diplomat, and who also happened to be her closest childhood friend, and also acted most certainly as her biggest headache these days.

Roshan was having a much easier time with their best friend, Aayat. They giggled as they gossiped over their keyboards and screens.

The room was an enclosure of boards carrying dozens of lit-up buttons, some with language keys and others with symbols. All of them were connected to a wall and two desks of flat screens. The two sat very close to each other, but manning their respective desks. Aayat was a petite young woman with a feminine figure and large curls. Roshan was a young, slim figure in a light green jumpsuit and tall black hair.

"Imagine! That!" Aayat gasped, trying not to choke on the candy in her mouth. "Should've known better! Snobby old Networkin' biiiiiitchhhh! Oh sorry, should I say, *Merchant* Networker Biiiiiiitchhhh!" She crunched one side of the candy between her jaws, munching effortlessly and loudly.

"Don't be mean to bitches, they're so cute!" Roshan retorted. "With their little metal toes, and their black button eyes, and everything! She *wishes* someone would look at her like she was a little bitch!"

Aayat nearly spat out the remaining half of her candy and made a funny sour face. Looking at each other, the two of them couldn't help it. The chain of laughter started all over again, with Aayat's chuckles ringing in a glorious series of chimes while Roshan grunted thoroughly and happily. "Oh, girl, I swear," Roshan finally sighed, "it's been so much more fun with you around!"

"What, you don't miss what's her name?" Aayat asked slyly.

"You *know* her name, girl!" Roshan laughed. "Now *you're* acting like a bitch!"

"I'm sorry!" Aayat laughed carelessly, tossing her curls back. "She's always been such a miserable...you know," Aayat snickered. "It's kind of amazing, the justice...now she's all up in her own asshole with the other people who are up in their assholes!"

"Oh, come on," Roshan groaned, cocking their head to the side.

"...And stuck with that little piece of gum, that little girl forever stuck to her. They're tuck together for eternity now, those two!" she cackled, cruelly.

"It's not *that* funny, girl! You don't know!" Roshan exclaimed. "Annie was...she had a good side, you know!"

Aayat rolled her dark brown eyes. "Yeah, as you've said. I dunno what you saw in that one. Always cold as ice with me. And I tried, babe. She was just cold, cold, cold." She picked at her fingers. "I didn't see no good side on any of her many, many sides."

Roshan stifled a chuckle. "*Girl*," they said, with the slightest hint of reproach. "You barely knew her, right?"

"Riiight, yeah," Aayat admitted. "I'm not like, a *hater*, Rosh," she conceded.

"I sat next to her for three years, and I think it took her 1 and a half years to warm up at all," Roshan concluded.

"I didn't need do *lecture*, babe!" Aayat exclaimed, half-laughing. "Enough of that one! Wait until I tell you...oh, geez, I almost missed this on my screen. Missing element, line XC7892. I'm sending it to your auxiliary 12."

"Copy. Got it," Roshan confirmed. They tapped the screen, reading into the details along with Aayat. They both looked over their screens in silence, their faces frowning deeper and deeper.

Aayat spoke up first. "Oh geez. Another drop in a Networker chain? This week?"

"This is fucked, Aayat," they replied, concern weighing down their typically light and wispy voice. "It's *never* been like this, never--"

"I know, Rosh," Aayat butted in. "I'm sending out the alert."

"No!" Roshan stopped her, sounding worried. "Wait!"

"What? What is it?" Aayat asked, worry beginning to catch her tone as wel.

"It's...it's...look who it is. Holy shit."

Aayat tapped the screen and saw some names. Her eyes widened in shock. "Oh...fuck, Rosh..."

Roshan shook his head over and over. "He's done."

"I know. Fuck, Aayat!" Roshan cried out, their hand now grabbing at their thick hair, pulling at it nervously.

It took a moment of silence and thought, but eventually, they both came back to reality. Roshan's hands slid from his hair to his side in a slump. Biting her lip, shaking her head, and drooping her shoulders, with all the signs of regret and sadness, Aayat finally said: "We have no choice, Rosh. This is our one thing. Our one purpose. I have to send out the alert. But..." she trailed off. "Oh, Rosh. I know what I said just now, before. But I'm not trying to hurt her. I swear. We have to send the alert." She pleaded, but was it really to Rosh?

"I know," Rosh answered, quiet and calming. "I definitely don't *want* to do it. I mean, it is a strike two..."

"Me too. It could be a misunderstanding...maybe...he's innocent, and he has evidence," Aayat said slowly, trying to be convincing. She was pausing, she was hesitant, she was careful.

Rosh took a deep breath, and then spoke hopefully. "Maybe you're right."

"Yeah, babe."

"Maybe...maybe this is just a mistake. Or someone else's...doing..." 

Aayat bit her lip even harder, turning away from Rosh altogether to stare at her screen. She held back her words and swallowed the lump in her throat. She didn't like sending the alerts out no matter who the recipient was, though this was particularly hard this time. But she knew she had to be strong.

For her first 2 years as a Watcher, she hadn't had to send out a single alert because there wasn't one issue in any chain, or any ownership issues detected by the systems. According to every Watcher who trained her, it was incredibly rare because all citizens wanted the system to work and for humans to prosper, and since the Programming was only meant for us to prosper, no one would want to break the chains or go against the systems...and that all seemed so true.

So, either someone else did the dirty work, or it was just so rare she never had to deal with it. But now, over the past week, she's had to send out three. This one was the worst one yet, being the first one related to someone that she actually knew. How many more times was this going to happen? Whether it was related to someone she knew or not, the result was always the same. And while she looked at life in a light-hearted way, there was no spin she could put on punishment. She couldn't see solitary confinement in the D.I.L. in any other way than dark, scary, and depressing. She didn't wish it on anyone.

"Girl? Can you hear me? Aayat?" she heard Roshan say, closer to her ear than she'd like. Roshan sounded like they were miles away, behind a cloud. 

So it was Roshan woke her from her stupor. "What?" she said, swallowing the spit in her mouth, trying to make the queasy feeling go away.

"Are you gonna be ok?" they asked. Their big glossy eyes traced over Aayat's face, up and down, up and down.

Aayat tapped the symbol to send the alert without another thought and still without looking back at them. "Done," she said.

"You didn't answer me."

"I did it, babe," she answered, staring at the screen's words. "Alert sent. Awaiting reply." 

Roshan reached out a hand and placed it on her knee. Aayat put her hand on theirs. They'd known each other for about a year because of the shared lunches. The Logic had determined that they should be together, at least for lunches, so they trusted in It. So far, their friendship has blossomed into something warm and trusting, and neither regretted opening their hearts. Aayat held Roshan's comforting hand, softly, feeling reassured.

"Let's go to that restaurant after hours and sit in the garden," they suggested. "Maybe there'll be strings players we can enjoy."

Aayat smiled, still not looking at them. "Yeah, I'd like that," she answered. "I'm gonna eat my body weight in fish."

"Awesome," they said. "It's not going to take the feelings away, but--"

"At least we're together," Aayat finished. Finally, she was looking right at Roshan. That's when her screen lit up with a reply from the Curator's side.

"Thank you for informing us," the reply started. It always began with the canned macro portion of the message. "We are authorizing you to send out a force to **Algernon B. Rus** immediately to deal with the matter and retrieve the work of creation."

The two stared at the message together.

"Well, time for me to inform dispatch." She pressed a button on a board of keys to her right and typed in a series of numbers matching ones on the screen and it was done. Tense, her eyes stayed on the blue glow, resting on the blankness in its finality Roshan squeezed Aayat's shoulders from behind, unsure of what to say, knowing that it would be best to say nothing this time, feeling their own worries building up in their stomach

The dance emporium was a hall of magnificent rose glass and silver bars. The different floors of the enormous, sprawling complex contained rehearsal room upon rehearsal room, space upon space for any dancer to take their time practicing. The emporium was built so that it would extend in the case of expansion, with bolted points at the edges of rooms where planks of hard synthetic floor material could be slid over. No matter what--if you were a dancer in Dulcity, you were given space.

And there were so many dancers in Dulcity! Almost every creator had danced, except for those few extremists who lay on the edges of the Creator class; fringe elements who worshipped other forms of arts so deeply that they were either propelled up to heights as purists or shunned as zealots.

Today, Genea was dancing alone in a room that hung over a fountain. It was her favourite sacred space, a haven for her body and her soul. Today, without music, she carved the invisible air in front of her with her hands, creating shapes only she could see. As she did every day, she felt blessed to have the time to practice. To create. To come up with something that would open others hearts to her.

Her latest project was a work based on the articulation of the shoulders and their connection to the elbows. This shoulder-elbow connection represented strength to Genea; the strength of carrying oneself and the strength of carrying another. She thought of her little brother while she did it. How lucky she was to have a brother at all! The fact that The Logic allowed her mother to have another child at all was a miracle in and of itself. How lucky they were as a family! So blessed that it fueled her art, and brought many patrons to her videos. She knew it and felt the immense pressure, even as she attempted a free-flowing exercise in the privacy of her favourite space.

She arched her back, and spread her shoulders wide like wings outstretched, her big grey eyes staring up at the grey-pink ceiling. It wasn't glass, but the synthetic material the floors were made of. She saw something of a grain, something Genea had noticed before, but then put it out of her mind. It wasn't important. Though she wondered if another artist had considered beautifying the material. It was odd to Genea how nothing about the material had changed over so much time, while so much around her was innovated into being more creative, more artistic. She worked very hard each day to bring something new to dance, after all. Did the Tactiles truly live so free of it? She shook that thought out of her head, too. But she might not have had to. She was interrupted by a voice.

"Genea, please report to Avenue Glazier F at your earliest convenience."

Her limber body straightened in an instant. "What?" she asked, her clipped voice ringing. "I wonder what that's about!"

Whistling, Genea strolled out of the room. The only thing she could consider was a new performance. It filled her with dread, the idea that she would have to put her current creation on hold. But the Curators may have their own ideas. She wondered if Curator Shuyin was behind this. Shuyin never stopped being obsessed with the island play.

*NOTE: I changed gears with this story rather quickly after realizing that the story was going nowhere, so consider this a reboot from here on out.*

It was afternoon in the dark marble halls; the towering rooms of black emerald dotted with moments of shadowy, blotchy coppers peeking out as ribbons from within the stone. And coppery too were the tangled metalwork designs hewn by ancient Creators bordering each doorway, striping across the tops of the columns, and twirling itself around the top corners of each wall.

Two young Dulcitars walked in through the largest double-door way that was already ready and opened for them. One of them was a short, bulky-looking figure with large, pouty lips on their full-moon, bright and fleshy, face. They wore a sleeveless overcoat over a tight bodysuit that showed off ever one of their feminine curves. The other was taller and slim, also wearing a bodysuit though much baggier, to the point where the sleeves looked like small wings. This one's face was overtaken with a large, characteristic nose and the bright eyes that topped it; glittering grey, those eyes were, with an icy edge. Though, they were relaxed in their stance compared to the other, whose shorter stature didn't matter--they held their body stiff and stern, hands on their hips.

They faced a long table of a dozen Curators and Senior Watchers - a committee for societal preservation, as it were, with no formal name. The senior figures wore closed robes in dark reds, greens, blues, and blacks, standing out in velvet against the hard cold stone backdrop of the room in their hard-resin chairs. Most of them had their hands placed on the long table in front of them, if not on their lap. They gazed over the two with emotionless and lifeless stares. They weren't old, but they gave off an aura of life ending; of stagnancy and near-death.

"Do you know why you are here?" asked one of them, stiffly. It was a Curator. The Senior Watcher sitting next to them cut in.

"For the recording, state your names, strata, and rank. Starting with you," the Senior Watcher directed, pointing at the impressive, voluptuous one.

She nodded before responding. "Aayat. Watcher, Second Class." Her voice rang out like the push of a horn, guttural and powerful.

The other figure stood a small step forward, their jumpsuit ruffling loudly in the echoing space. "Roshan," they said, their voice sliding out between their lips, smooth and controlled. "Watcher. First Class." They sighed.

The Senior Watcher, a man who resembled a stick insect with big eyes more than anything else, retorted at the light sound of Roshan's huff. "Oh, I'm *sorry*, Roshan. I know how much all this formality *irritates* and *inconveniences* you. I sure hope you can handle all of this while we try to talk about *the force trying to take over all of Dulcity!*"

The other Senior Watchers and Curators hummed with troubled energy at the outburst. "Alishaam, will you control yourself?" one tut-tutted at the grumpy, stick-faced man. "Can we get through a single session without drama, *please*?" said another, tapping her fingers on the table.

"Silence!" Alishaam cried out. "I will have order!"

"You're the--"

Alishaam wouldn't be stopped. "Roshan. Aayat. You are here to confirm some statements before we reconvene to discuss specific actions--"

Roshan sighed again, though much more audibly this time, and crossed his arms. His ace showed only one thing: disappointment.

"Rosh, are you going to say something or sigh them to death?" Aayat mumbled from the side of her lips. "They won't--"

"Do you have something you'd like to say, young lady, Second class?" Alishaam dryly asked. Aayat and Roshan exchanged glances; Roshan looking apologetic and Aayat quickly switching to an eyeroll.

"We've given our story and our evidence on two different occasions, now," she started. Upon seeing the narrowed eyes of the entire table, Aayat stopped.

Roshan jumped in to the rescue. "Why can't we just...decide now? What's the holdup?"

The entire table erupted in a sea of gasps, clutches, and shocked utterances: "Who do they think they are?" "Don't they know how this works?" "They are out of line!"

Alishaam shook his head slowly. "It appears these young, impressionable Watchers are letting impatience cloud their judgment," he said, a comically-exaggerated tone of regret forced on his words. "It looks as though we, who have been making the most important decisions about Dulcity's security for *years*, need to learn a thing or two--"

Aayat had had enough. "Fine, we'll do whatever. What statements are we confirming? The sooner we do this--"

"The sooner you can make your decisions," Roshan concluded. The two exchanged glanced again, this time, with warm smiles.

The table was quieter, but who's to say what did it. Was it the confident tension of these two young Watcher officers? Or was it the sense of real dread that kept permeating everyone's thoughts, making them stop every once in a while. After all...

"Here are the statements to confirm," a Curator read from a piece of paper. Her husky voice read each statement like a final judgment.

"First, you were both working at the time of the incident."

Answering in unison: "Yes."

"Second, Aayat was the first to perceive the discrepancy."

"Yes," they answered again.

"Third, Roshan confirmed the discrepancy on their screens and in the raw auxiliary code."

"Yes."

"Fourth, Aayat kept the running list of discrepancy codes in her personal Watcher database."

"Yes."

"Fifth, Roshan saw the pattern between the discrepancy codes on Aayat's list."

"Yes."

And so on they went, a total of twenty-eight questions. All recording devices were imperceptibly noting down the confirmation from multiple angles: some where the entire room was visible, others where Aayat and/or Roshan's faces were fully captured. The invisible recorders, the pride of the old Watcher-Tactile alliance,
