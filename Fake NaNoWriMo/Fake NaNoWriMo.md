A crystalline structure hovers in a sea of black and blue, surrounded by a misty fog. The glass which makes the crystal-like island shimmer from within, giving it its geometric shape, was tinted a shade of light blue. Each pane, enormous in size and perfect in its clarity, was framed in silver, making a sort of fractal grid. Our point of view is unique; no living thing has been able to see this hovering, pulsating thing out in space, not for a very long time. Nowadays, it is seen in diagrams, in photos in sections, and in small pieces. Of course, it is mostly seen from within, where it is even more glorious.

The word "intricate" doesn't begin to describe the structure that is Dulcity. There are areas equally seen and unseen in bright lights, divided by walls, floors, screens, and ever-moving slats of metal. Dulcity was a floating island completely lived in, in both dark and light, while containing multiple shimmers of rainbow color all at once. It was a bottle of life, constantly alive, the lights constantly flashing in a constant rhythm; some regular and others spontaneous. Dulcity loved color because its people loved color.

On this day, Dulcity was twinkling and glittering in the sea of space, as it always did, ever so slowly. And it always would, so safely, unaware of what was outside of it. That was fine. There was nothing to think about outside Dulcity. They had to maintain their systems and their hardware and of course, themselves. That was enough work already. They were the last living people, and they were going to spend their time leaving a legacy to each other and themselves. After all, everyone else was dead.

The room was emerald with gold accents. The emerald washed over the walls, floor, and straight-edged columns in the form of elegant gleaming marble. The gold took the form of bold stripes and small curlicues on the edges of all the framed artworks that hung on the four walls, but it also made up the entire thick, bordered frame of a heavy, rectangular mirror, about 5 persons wide and 2 persons tall. The mirror stood in the center of the room as the columns surrounded it like they were its protectors. A smell of crisp apple wafted through the air, and a fresh breeze blew coolness into the room. You could hear the sound of gentle running water coming from outside the room because the double doors were left wide open to the grey stone garden.

Two women stood in front of the mirror. One stared straight into it; a tall redhead with a thick, muscular and toned body wearing a small white cropped undershirt and a pair of small black shorts. Her grey eyes looked empty, matching the rest of her emotionless face. It looked like she might be dissociating. The other woman was a shorter, bright-looking woman wearing a red dress that ended at her knees. She had blonde hair in two braids that hung over her shoulders. She shuffled her feet, looking at the other woman expectantly, her arms crossed. The blonde woman was standing in front of a stand with two dresses hanging on it - a long, black affair and a beige skirt suit.

"Have you made a decision, Annie?" asked the one with the blonde braids. "We have to get you ready," she implored, her tone getting sharper. She has the trill of a bird in her high pitched voice; a lightness and singsongy quality that would sound lovely if she weren't so impatient.

Annie didn't respond.

"Anastacia?" the blonde one asked, tentatively. Anastacia now turned her head. "Anastacia, have you decided?" the blonde asked again.

"The black one, Ollie," Anastacia responded in a dull tone. She had a thicker voice, deeper and richer, coming from the belly and the chest. 

"That'll be with the heels and lighter makeup then, and the hair--"

"No heels, I hate them," Anastacia interrupted. She put her hands on her hips and stared into the mirror, as if menacing herself. But Ollie grimaced.

"You know the heels go with the black dress."

Anastacia shook her head. "No heels. I don't care."

"You have to care. You'll be disrespecting the creation."

Anastacia narrowed her almond eyes to a tight squint. She huffed but didn't say anything.

Ollie sighed. "We'll do a half heel sort of thing. A compromise. I'll explain you get dizzy. But there'll be rumours you're not healthy, do you get it?"

"Yeah, don't care." Anastacia shrugged. Her figure softened and she turned to the rack. "Let's just get this thing on."

Ollie smiled. "Good, good, let's get it done! Always good to just...get it done and over with..."

"That's all you'll get from me."

Ollie turned away from Anastacia to cringe, and to walk towards a small metal box about Ollie's knee height. She tapped the top to reveal some glowing symbols, and after some more presses, a door on the front of the box opened. A pair of black open-toed heels made of a synthetic leather slid out together on a metal plate. Ollie picked them up and turned to bring them to Anastacia, who had already started to put the dress on. Ollie shook her head.

"I wish you'd wait..." she started, but it was no use and she knew it. She tut-tutted as she approached Anastacia. "Let me help you," Ollie insisted. Anastacia did nothing but grunt as she pulled the skirt of the dress up past her curvaceous hips. Ollie smiled at the sight. She knew Anastacia was going to look phenomenal tonight, and that, at least, was a good thing. A great thing, actually, for Ollie. Ollie was going to be successful, no matter what, and nothing would reflect badly on her this time. 

Ollie tugged at the waist and helped Anastacia with the dress's transparent sleeves, covered in abstract lines in a sort of embroidered net on the thin mesh-like fabric. It looked so fragile, but it held well against the harsh lines and strong shapes of Anastacia's arms and shoulders. The straight line over her collar created the stark contrast between her dusky skin and the velvety black. Anastacia looked beautiful. Her body looked beautiful. Ollie got the shoes on Anastacia's feet and she now towered like a statue. Anastacia was more than beautiful now, she was a walking monument to the potential of human life. Ollie's eyelashes fluttered. That would be her Annie up there, tonight.

"Makeup," Ollie said aloud, breaking the spell on herself. "Be right back."

She picked up a bag that looked like a silky cushion with woven handles and opened it on the ottoman in front of the mirror. "Alright, take a seat and we'll get you finished in a minute."

Anastacia wordlessly did as she was told with the blank stare in her eyes again. She was somewhere else.

Ollie began with the makeup in silence. She began by highlighting the high cheekbones Anastacia was blessed with, than moved on to deepening the colour Anastacia's lips desperately needed. As soon as the lips were done, Anastacia began to speak.

"Do you remember school at all, Ollie?"

Ollie's lips parted in surprise. She blinked a few times, speechless and unsure. She spoke in a light, whispery voice in response, so different than her authoritarian little chirps. "S-sure, don't you? Doesn't everyone?"

Anastacia smiled. "Don't you think about those days? All the funny little stories of the past?" Her eyes filled with tears and Ollie was relieved she hadn't started there yet.

"Oh! Don't get that way!" Ollie whispered, rushing her words as she began to panic. Her face was so close to Anastacia's and she could see the way the tears in Anastacia's left eye were pooling in the very corner, threatening to leak out and it made her heart quicken. 

Ollie picked up a tissue and made a move to dab at Anastacia's eyes, but Anastacia pushed her hand away. "I'm fine. Just give me the tissue." She did it herself, with Ollie waiting patiently.

Anastacia signalled to Ollie. She held out the used tissue, like she wanted Ollie to throw it away for her. As Ollie took the tissue, Anastacia reached out with her other hand and held Ollie's hand for a brief moment. "You were always...you're my best friend," she said. "We've been best friends forever, since we went to school together as kids with the rest of the Tacticles."

Ollie creased her eyebrows in concern. "I know how we grew up, Annie!" she exclaimed, exasperated.

Anastacia still went on the same way. "Do you remember what we used to do together? How we used to live? How you used to talk to me?"

"I'm sorry but I don't understand your point," Ollie said, restraining herself with a gritting of her teeth.

"And...do you realize how different you sound now?" asked Anastacia, her eyes boring into Ollie's. A stranger would find her glare intimidating for one reason, but Ollie felt that way for her own, very personal, reason.

"You're always bringing this up but you never say what you mean. You need to speak to someone about this," Ollie said, turning her eyes away from her friend. Because that is the truth, they were indeed friends. Just not right now.

Anastacia said nothing more. Ollie waited a few seconds before resuming her job, which was to beautify and personally assist one of the most important Curators in Dulcity, who also happened to be one of the most difficult Curators in Dulcity, and who also happened to be the Chosen Partner to the Curator Diplomat, and who also happened to be her closest childhood friend, and also acted most certainly as her biggest headache these days.

Roshan was having a much easier time with their best friend, Aayat. They giggled as they gossiped over their keyboards and screens.

The room was an enclosure of boards carrying dozens of lit-up buttons, some with language keys and others with symbols. All of them were connected to a wall and two desks of flat screens. The two sat very close to each other, but manning their respective desks. Aayat was a petite young woman with a feminine figure and large curls. Roshan was a young, slim figure in a light green jumpsuit and tall black hair.

"Imagine! That!" Aayat gasped, trying not to choke on the candy in her mouth. "Should've known better! Snobby old Networkin' biiiiiitchhhh! Oh sorry, should I say, *Merchant* Networker Biiiiiiitchhhh!" She crunched one side of the candy between her jaws, munching effortlessly and loudly.

"Don't be mean to bitches, they're so cute!" Roshan retorted. "With their little metal toes, and their black button eyes, and everything! She *wishes* someone would look at her like she was a little bitch!"

Aayat nearly spat out the remaining half of her candy and made a funny sour face. Looking at each other, the two of them couldn't help it. The chain of laughter started all over again, with Aayat's chuckles ringing in a glorious series of chimes while Roshan grunted thoroughly and happily. "Oh, girl, I swear," Roshan finally sighed, "it's been so much more fun with you around!"

"What, you don't miss what's her name?" Aayat asked slyly.

"You *know* her name, girl!" Roshan laughed. "Now *you're* acting like a bitch!"

"I'm sorry!" Aayat laughed carelessly, tossing her curls back. "She's always been such a miserable...you know," Aayat snickered. "It's kind of amazing, the justice...now she's all up in her own asshole with the other people who are up in their assholes!"

"Oh, come on," Roshan groaned, cocking their head to the side.

"...And stuck with that little piece of gum, that little girl forever stuck to her. They're tuck together for eternity now, those two!" she cackled, cruelly.

"It's not *that* funny, girl! You don't know!" Roshan exclaimed. "Annie was...she had a good side, you know!"

Aayat rolled her dark brown eyes. "Yeah, as you've said. I dunno what you saw in that one. Always cold as ice with me. And I tried, babe. She was just cold, cold, cold." She picked at her fingers. "I didn't see no good side on any of her many, many sides."

Roshan stifled a chuckle. "*Girl*," they said, with the slightest hint of reproach. "You barely knew her, right?"

"Riiight, yeah," Aayat admitted. "I'm not like, a *hater*, Rosh," she conceded.

"I sat next to her for three years, and I think it took her 1 and a half years to warm up at all," Roshan concluded.

"I didn't need do *lecture*, babe!" Aayat exclaimed, half-laughing. "Enough of that one! Wait until I tell you...oh, geez, I almost missed this on my screen. Missing element, line XC7892. I'm sending it to your auxiliary 12."

"Copy. Got it," Roshan confirmed. They tapped the screen, reading into the details along with Aayat. They both looked over their screens in silence, their faces frowning deeper and deeper.

Aayat spoke up first. "Oh geez. Another drop in a Networker chain? This week?"

"This is fucked, Aayat," they replied, concern weighing down their typically light and wispy voice. "It's *never* been like this, never--"

"I know, Rosh," Aayat butted in. "I'm sending out the alert."

"No!" Roshan stopped her, sounding worried. "Wait!"

"What? What is it?" Aayat asked, worry beginning to catch her tone as wel.

"It's...it's...look who it is. Holy shit."

Aayat tapped the screen and saw some names. Her eyes widened in shock. "Oh...fuck, Rosh..."

Roshan shook his head over and over. "He's done."

"I know. Fuck, Aayat!" Roshan cried out, their hand now grabbing at their thick hair, pulling at it nervously.

It took a moment of silence and thought, but eventually, they both came back to reality. Roshan's hands slid from his hair to his side in a slump. Biting her lip, shaking her head, and drooping her shoulders, with all the signs of regret and sadness, Aayat finally said: "We have no choice, Rosh. This is our one thing. Our one purpose. I have to send out the alert. But..." she trailed off. "Oh, Rosh. I know what I said just now, before. But I'm not trying to hurt her. I swear. We have to send the alert." She pleaded, but was it really to Rosh?

"I know," Rosh answered, quiet and calming. "I definitely don't *want* to do it. I mean, it is a strike two..."

"Me too. It could be a misunderstanding...maybe...he's innocent, and he has evidence," Aayat said slowly, trying to be convincing. She was pausing, she was hesitant, she was careful.

Rosh took a deep breath, and then spoke hopefully. "Maybe you're right."

"Yeah, babe."

"Maybe...maybe this is just a mistake. Or someone else's...doing..." 

Aayat bit her lip even harder, turning away from Rosh altogether to stare at her screen. She held back her words and swallowed the lump in her throat. She didn't like sending the alerts out no matter who the recipient was, though this was particularly hard this time. But she knew she had to be strong.

For her first 2 years as a Watcher, she hadn't had to send out a single alert because there wasn't one issue in any chain, or any ownership issues detected by the systems. According to every Watcher who trained her, it was incredibly rare because all citizens wanted the system to work and for humans to prosper, and since the Programming was only meant for us to prosper, no one would want to break the chains or go against the systems...and that all seemed so true.

So, either someone else did the dirty work, or it was just so rare she never had to deal with it. But now, over the past week, she's had to send out three. This one was the worst one yet, being the first one related to someone that she actually knew. How many more times was this going to happen? Whether it was related to someone she knew or not, the result was always the same. And while she looked at life in a light-hearted way, there was no spin she could put on punishment. She couldn't see solitary confinement in the D.I.L. in any other way than dark, scary, and depressing. She didn't wish it on anyone.

"Girl? Can you hear me? Aayat?" she heard Roshan say, closer to her ear than she'd like. Roshan sounded like they were miles away, behind a cloud. 

So it was Roshan woke her from her stupor. "What?" she said, swallowing the spit in her mouth, trying to make the queasy feeling go away.

"Are you gonna be ok?" they asked. Their big glossy eyes traced over Aayat's face, up and down, up and down.

Aayat tapped the symbol to send the alert without another thought and still without looking back at them. "Done," she said.

"You didn't answer me."

"I did it, babe," she answered, staring at the screen's words. "Alert sent. Awaiting reply." 

Roshan reached out a hand and placed it on her knee. Aayat put her hand on theirs. They'd known each other for about a year because of the shared lunches. The Logic had determined that they should be together, at least for lunches, so they trusted in It. So far, their friendship has blossomed into something warm and trusting, and neither regretted opening their hearts. Aayat held Roshan's comforting hand, softly, feeling reassured.

"Let's go to that restaurant after hours and sit in the garden," they suggested. "Maybe there'll be strings players we can enjoy."

Aayat smiled, still not looking at them. "Yeah, I'd like that," she answered. "I'm gonna eat my body weight in fish."

"Awesome," they said. "It's not going to take the feelings away, but--"

"At least we're together," Aayat finished. Finally, she was looking right at Roshan. That's when her screen lit up with a reply from the Curator's side.

"Thank you for informing us," the reply started. It always began with the canned macro portion of the message. "We are authorizing you to send out a force to **Algernon B. Rus** immediately to deal with the matter and retrieve the work of creation."

The two stared at the message together.

"Well, time for me to inform dispatch." She pressed a button on a board of keys to her right and typed in a series of numbers matching ones on the screen and it was done. Roshan squeezed Aayat's shoulders from behind.

"It is what it is," Aayat said. "It's in his hands now."
