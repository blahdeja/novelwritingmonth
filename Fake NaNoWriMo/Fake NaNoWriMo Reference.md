Last colony that survived after a disaster
tried to create a society that prioritized philosophy, arts, etc. over conquest and war
limited the space to an island
programmed a ruling machine with advanced programming
set the society up to be maintained a specific way
defrosted a bunch of sperm/eggs and cultivated the new society
Old Planet/World: Dulhaniya (the Bride/Groom/World)

Island - Niy-ya
City - Dulcity
City Center/City "Heart" - D.I.L. (Dulcity Interior Locality or "Dil")

All names of stratas have an old language name and a new language name. People know of these names but it doesn't mean much to most people in this time period.

Strata of Society:
- Workers, repairpersons, maintenance - Mainteniyya -> Tactiles
- The merchants - Paisaniyya -> Networkers/Merchant Networkers (depends on who you ask)
- The watchers - Dataniyya -> Watchers
- The curators (elite ruing class) - Programmaniyya -> Curators
- The performers - Tawayiffiyya -> Creators

The machine, a robot/computer that rules over everything - The Logic
Its core programming was created by one of the first repairpersons to ever exist, and since then, it's just been maintained to be the same because no one has dared to touch the programming, it's a sacred text almost
There is programming that the curators modify to suit the needs of the citizens called "periphery programming" such as distribution of personal apartments, introducing new systems or improving existing systems (like making the laundry system work better) - maintenance people also work on the periphery programming to an extent as it has to do with the hardware (ie to take the laundry system a step further, the maintenance strata has to know how to repair the laundry machine including some kind of issue with the local machine's programming)

excerpts from the programming
- one should stay in their family until the programming decides a change to another strata
- no matter the age, when there is a change in strata, the training starts at the first stage
- one you become a curator, you will not switch to another strata
- the programming will appoint a diplomat for each strata
- the final product of the entire system appears to be artworks (or works of creation) that flow through the network of merchants and people
- all works of creation are tracked as data points from the point of creation and throughout ownership (the cornerstone rule)
- curators may be aligned with each other in permanent marriages if the programming deems it necessary

maintenance strata - Tacticles
Interfaces with local periphery programming
Interfaces with hardware all over the city
lives unseen in windowless buildings and under the ground in artificially-lit caverns

merchant strata - Networkers
works with the creators in the curator strata to sell their goods to people across all strata
maintains a network of merchants to have a steady flow of items
maintains a database of items that are all tracked from the point of creation to the point of sale

watcher strata - Watchers
maintains databases of all living and dead people in the city
maintains databases of all the works of creation
enforces accurate tracking of all creative works (ie acts as a police force)
smallest strata, elite in its own way - even the curators cannot shape them

curator strata - Curators
Interfaces with the programming
Organizes the monthly festivities
Trains performers (who perform during the abovementioned festivities)

performer/artist strata - Creators
life with curators but they are not of the same strata

In this story, a woman is unhappy because the programming set her up in a marriage with someone she doesn't want to marry; a diplomat who doesn't understand her problem. She's frustrated in general because she never wanted to be in the curator strata to begin with
Her father was a Tactile who was arrested for gifting an artwork to someone without informing the watchers in a timely manner. She's never been happy with the way things are and she's starting to feel very alone.
